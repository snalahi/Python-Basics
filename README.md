*** Truncated division in python:
(10 // 3) => 3; Wipes out all the decimal points

*** Modulo operator
(10 % 3) => 1; Provides the remainder of the operation

*** Order of operation
1. Parenthesis
2. Exponentiation
3. Multiplication and Division
4. Addition and Subtraction

*** Functions are objects in Python
e.g. print(square) => <function square>

*** Data Type
type() gives us the type of the given value
e.g. type("") => <class 'str'>
type(2) => <class 'int'>
type(3.5) => <class 'float'>

*** String
print('''"Oh, no" she exclaimed, "Ben's bike is broken"''') => "Oh, no" she exclaimed, "Ben's bike is broken" 

*** Variables
message = ""
n = 13
pi = 3.14
THE ABOVE ARE SET VARIABLES

print(message)
print(n)
print(pi)
THE ABOVE ARE REFERENCE VARIABLES

Variable names always start with a letter
"_" is treated as a character in python

*** There is a cool function called input() which takes user input from command line. The function does
not need to be explicitly stated. Whenever the program execution comes accross the input() function in any
form, it stops and ask for user input.

for instance,
n = input("Please enter your name: ") #input function with a prompt in the assignment(implicitly stated)
print("Hello", n) #the comma creates a space between Hello and the input


```
